# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks-data-analysis
For this project, i wll act as a data analyst for the National Park Service.  i wll be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.  The National Parks Service would like to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project,i will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.  After i perform analysis, i wll be creating a presentation to share my findings with the National Park Service
